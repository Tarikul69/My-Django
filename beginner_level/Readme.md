## ðŸŸ¢ Model Relationships (OneToOne, ForeignKey, ManyToMany)
In Django, model relationships define how models (tables) connect to each other in a database.


## ðŸŸ¢ Migrations and ORM
In this chapter, we will cover the basics of migrations and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
in Django. We will also cover how to use the ORM to interact with the database.
#### 1. Make changes in models.py
#### 2. Create migration files
```
python manage.py makemigrations
```
#### 3. Apply changes to the DB
```
python manage.py migrate
```
